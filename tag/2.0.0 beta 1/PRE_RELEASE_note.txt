This is a prerelease package of OpenMcdf not aimed to production use.

Please, feel free to use it for testing purpose, bug checking and reporting and new/missing feature requests.

There are ony little changes in API but a lot of things have changed internally: 

-RedBlack tree structure for directory items allow OpenMcdf to handle thousands of stream and storage objects.
-Extension methods provide access to stream items as native Stream object and 
-Extension for OLE properties handling is 'work in progress' (still unreleased)

Enjoy OpenMcdf 2.0 !
